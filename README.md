      Upon creation of events, users are prompted for the priority of their event. This priority has to be between 1 and 3 or the event will not be created. The priority of each event is automatically saved with in the database as a feature. This enables users to sort their events by priorities and see their most prioritized events for the month. This is displayed under the calendar grid labeled "High Priority Events this Month". The displayed events are only events that have a priority of 3. (most prioritized).

2. To-Do list

      After selecting a day on the calendar, a sorting feature has been integrated to the event view that allows the user to sort the events. The user may sort the events by their priorities, titles or times by choosing from a dropdown menu.
